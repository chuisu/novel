This is a time travel story that capitalizes on some mindfuckery that happens whenever someone travels through time.

Ben finds signs of time travel thoughout life and finds some unavoidable evidence of its existence in current time
Something happens where Ben needs the powers of time travel to solve a desperate problem
Grace has been time travelling throughout her life purely accidentally
  There is some sort of reason for her "accidental" time travel, to be revealed later
Ben gets wind that Grace is a time traveller
Ben and Grace have a fateful meeting wherein she is Grace from the future who tells Ben only what he needs to know, but manupulates him to her ends (which we don't know what they are)
Future Grace has Ben gather objects that mean a lot to him, Anchors in this timeline
Present Grace finds out what Future Grace is doing, and attempts to try to inform Ben what her plan is
  Each time, she slips out of present time so that Future Grace can intercept
  This should feel like a love story where the lovers are separated and unable to talk to one another
She starts keeping a log in her notebook of exactly when these incidents took place
She starts leaving notes as cryptic messages to Ben in key places and at key times
Ben starts writing back, unsure of whether or not the notes will actually reach Grace
They really do start falling in love.
There is a point at which she doesn't take a note, and this is a time she can actually talk to Ben


Things to remember:
Make the reader ask a really obvious question that drives the plot (who's flying the plane once everyone's disappeared?)
