Ben glanced over the belongings he had placed on his desk the night before. Though his possessions since childhood, they seemed hardly his. The doll, once filled with childrens' imagination and life, was now lifeless, with shark eyes; its hair hanging limply down, made of only cotton. The penny, once imbued with native blessings, was much less than lucky, as they'd found out through the years. These items did not incite any memories. Maybe once they did, but now, with such dread hanging over Ben's humble head, he hadn't the space to think of anything else but the future.

The rain came pouring now, the wind spattering it about his second story window. Just above it, he heard a soft knock. Grace.

Grace was not the one who knocked, though she had every intention of doing so. Rather, just as she stood at his threshold and formed her loose fist, and was just about to rap it upon Ben's door, she was elsewhere.

Grace hung, suspended in the air, and splayed out before her was the dusk of a foreign land. Elongated shadows stroked unanimously the earth, about which the light of the setting sun played, spilling myriad colors. Breathless, she figured she was about ten feet from the ground before she realized what had happened. She managed to get out a breathy "oh frick oh frick oh frick," before she could catch herself on the green branch of a sapling. Despite the implications of her name, the break from her fall was hard, and Grace was quick to check for any disabling injuries when springing back up.

Ben was already heading to answer his door as another group of knocks graced it, more urgent this time.
